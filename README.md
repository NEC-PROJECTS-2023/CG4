### About Project

The COVID-19 pandemic had a variety of effects on global health, the global economy, and global lifestyle. Thus, it is essential to identify viruses early in order to treat patients more effectively. With the help of deep learning methods such convolutional neural networks (CNN), VGG16, and VGG19, this research will examine the detection of COVID-19 in x-ray pictures. The actual diagnosis test, called RT-PCR for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, is quite expensive and takes a long time to get results. Thus, additional sophisticated testing and diagnostic instruments are required. Inspired by the recent research that is used to detect the COVID-19 presence in the X-ray images , this research uses deep learning methods and algorithms to process these images and classify them as covid positive or covid negative cases respectively. The proposed approach includes the pre-processing of the x-ray images which includes removing of the irrelevant surroundings and bias producing results. After the pre-processing stage, training the classification model under the transfer learning scheme, and results are analysed and interpreted through visualization. In this approach, we achieved the accuracy of 95% using the CNN models.
